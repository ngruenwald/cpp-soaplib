===============

This is a toolkit for C++ to create SOAP client applications.

It includes a generator *(soapgen)* that will turn a service defintion (WSDL)
into C++ code. Currently it only supports single file definitions.

The library itself uses `cpp-httplib` for the basic HTTP handling.
`LibXml2` is used for the XML processing.


| **WARNING**
| This project was written to access some custom WCF SOAP services.
| I have never read any spec, nor have I tested this against other services.
| Do not expect this to work!  Â¯\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
